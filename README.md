# Hello!! I'm Yago rocha!!

I work as a software developer with solid experience in Java, Spring Boot, and microservices architecture. I develop and maintain scalable and resilient solutions, always focusing on performance, security, and stability.

My experience includes RabbitMQ, Docker, and AWS, working in cloud environments and integrating distributed services. I have a proven track record of implementing best development practices to deliver efficient, reliable applications aligned with business needs.

In addition to back-end development, I am currently working as a front-end developer, using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create functional and responsive interfaces.
I am constantly seeking to improve my technical skills and contribute to high-impact projects.
